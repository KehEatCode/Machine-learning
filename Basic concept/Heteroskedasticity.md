# Heteroskedasticity

- Variance of Wi changes with i 随机误差项Wi有不同的方差

- Variance of (Y|X) is not constant, the variance will decrease or increase with more X

- With different **spread**

- If we know the variance({\displaystyle \sigma ^{2}}\sigma^2), in order to minimize the sum square of residual, we could use a weighted least squares criterion; more weight on a little noise, less weight on noisy data
