# Linear regression

- Linear regression is a way to identify relationship between the independent variable(s) and the dependentvariable.

- We can use these relationships to predict values for one variable for given value(s) of other variable(s).

- It assumes the relationship between variables can be modeled through linear equation or an equation of theline.‚óèThe variable, which is used in prediction is termed as independent/explanatory/regressor, whereas thepredicted variable is termed as dependent/target/response variable.

- In case of linear regression with a single explanatory variable, the linear combination can be expressed as:
  
  - response  = intercept + constant * explanatory variable
