# Multiple linear regression 

- A regression model with multiple variables.

- In the real world, any phenomenon or outcome could be driven by many different independent variables.

- Therefore there is a need to have a mathematical model that can capture this relationship.

    - Ex: Predicting the price of a house, we need to consider various attributes such as area, number of rooms, number of kitchens, etc.  Such a regression problem is an example of multiple linear regression.
    
    - The equation for multiple linear regression can be represented by: 
    
         - target = intercept + constant 1*feature 1 + constant 2*feature 2 + constant 3*feature 3 + .....
         
         - The model aims to find the constants and intercept such that this line is the best fit.32
