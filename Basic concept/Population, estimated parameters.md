# Population and estimated parameters

- Standard deviation 
    - The standard deviation tells us how the data are spread around the mean

- Population parameters
    - Mean and standard deviation 

- why estimate?
    - Since we rearely have enough time and money to measure every single thing in a population, we almost always estimate the **population parameters** using a relatively small sample.
