# p-value

- The closer a p-value is to zero, the more confidence we have the two variable are different

- A commonly used threhold is 0.05. 

    - There is no difference between a and b. 
    
    - if we did this experiment a bunch of times, then only 5% of those experiments would result in the wrong decision.
