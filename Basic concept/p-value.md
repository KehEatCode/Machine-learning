# p-value

- 帮我们决定是否应该拒绝原假设

- The closer a p-value is to zero, the more confidence we have the two variable are different

- p值越低，原假设越荒谬；我们就拒绝这一假设来选择备择假设

- A commonly used threhold is 0.05. 

    - which means there are only 5% of the differences come from weird random things 只有5%差异的可能性来自于随机，这保证了实验结果的稳定性

    - There is no difference between a and b. 
    
    - if we did this experiment a bunch of times, then only 5% of those experiments would result in the wrong decision.

- p value can be divided into 2 types: one-side p value and two-side p value

- A p value is used in hypothesis testing to help you support or reject the null hypothesis. 
- 
- The p value is the evidence against a null hypothesis. The smaller the p-value, the stronger the evidence that you should reject the null hypothesis.

- P values are expressed as decimals although it may be easier to understand what they are if you convert them to a percentage. 

    - For example, a p value of 0.0254 is 2.54%. This means there is a 2.54% chance your results could be random (i.e. happened by chance). That’s pretty tiny. On the other hand, a large p-value of .9(90%) means your results have a 90% probability of being completely random and not due to anything in your experiment. Therefore, the smaller the p-value, the more important (“significant“) your results.
