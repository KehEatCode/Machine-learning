# Normal distribution

- Bell-shaped curve with symmetrical curve 

- y-axis representents the relative probability of observing XXX, higher probability higher the curve
    - The below curve shows that there is a high probability of measuring a newborn baby boy within ∓ 1.2 inches of the mean

- Always centered with the **average value**

- 大人的身高可能性有很多，因此曲线更加平坦；但是小孩的身高可能性较少，因此曲线比较集中

- The width of the curve is defined by the **standard deviation**

- The normal curves are drawn such that 95% of the measurements fall between ∓ 2*standard deviation around the mean
    - 正态曲线使得95%的测量值落在平均值的正负两个标准差之间

- 曲线的宽度由标准差来定义，而孩子的标准差在上图比成人小; sd of child=0.6; for adult is 4

- 正态分布有95%的概率落在 mean ∓ 2sd： 95% of baby measurements fall between 20∓1.2 inches. and 95% of the adult measurements fall between 70 ∓ 8 inches

- Tips

  -  (1) the average measurements, this can help find where center of the curve goes

  -  (2) the standard deviation of the measurements, this tells you how wide the curve should be. The width of the curve determines how tall it is. 
    - The wider the curve, the shorter. The narrower the curve, the taller.
