# Probability distribution

- Both the histogram and the curve are distribution 

- They show how the probabilities of measurements are distributed.

  - The tallest part of the histogram (or curve), shows the region where measurements are most likely

  - The low parts of the histogram or curve, show where measurements are less likely
