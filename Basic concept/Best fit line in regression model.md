# Best fit line in the linear regression model

- Learning from the data, the model generates a line that fits the data.

- Our aim is to find a regression line that best fits the data.

- By best fit, it means that the line will be such that the cumulative distance of all the points from the line is minimized.

- Mathematically, the line that minimizes the sum of squared error of residuals is called the Regression Line or the Line of Best Fit.

- In the example here, you can see a scatter plot between the total_tip amount and the total_bill amount.

- We can see that there is a positive correlation between these variables. As the bill amount increases, the tip increases.●The blue line is the ‘best fit’ line and those in red are some examples of other lines that are not the ‘best fit’.
